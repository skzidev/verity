# Verity 2026.1

This file details the Verity programming language in its 2026.1 version, including syntax and semantics.

## Goals

The Verity language has one main goal: to provide a powerful yet abstracted developer experience. Code should run efficiently, and programming should be safe and intuitive.

Verity should be able to support interop through the C ABI as well, and should include many safety features, including memory safety.

## Syntax

Verity is designed to have a readible syntax, and is designed to offer the programmer extra information, without being verbose.
