# Contributing to Verity

First of all, thank you for wanting to contribute to the Verity language and/or the Verity compiler. Even if your contribution isn't accepted, we appreciate you taking the time and effort to contribute.

### Code Formatting

It is recommended that contributions use tabs, 4 spaces wide with LF newlines for consistency. Your pull request should not be rejected if formatting does not fully follow these guidelines though.
